# CS3960---Traffic-Tracker

This is my implementation of UrbanPulse, the Traffic Tracker. 
It is very naive. It takes dummy data and shows an icon representing the "current" traffic levels for each road.
In a real implementation, I imagine it would be overlain on a real map and have data for each road in a city.
